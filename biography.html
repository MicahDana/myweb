    My teenage years were a time of self-discovery and challenges, especially during high school.<sub>1</sub> I initially aspired to enter Quezon City Science High School, but after failing the entrance exam, I was heartbroken, not because I didnâ€™t pass, but because I feared disappointing my parents.<sub>2</sub> My older sister had successfully entered the school and later secured a scholarship at the University of the Philippines, setting a high standard.<sub>3</sub> However, my parents reassured me that trying my best was what truly mattered.<sub>4</sub> Instead, I attended Quezon City Academy, where I experienced a culture shock, as it was my first time transferring schools and adjusting to a larger environment.<sub>5</sub> I struggled with my self-esteem, felt overwhelmed, and initially refrained from participating in extracurricular activities.<sub>6</sub> The transition was difficult, and I often compared myself to my peers, wondering if I was good enough.<sub>7</sub> Despite these challenges, I remained a consistent honor student and ranked among the top in my grade level.<sub>8</sub> Over time, I developed close friendships, though I became more introverted and cautious in trusting new people.<sub>9</sub> I realized the importance of surrounding myself with genuine friends who uplifted and supported me.<sub>10</sub> For senior high school, I enrolled in the University of the East Caloocan under the STEM strand.<sub>11</sub> This phase of my life was more enjoyable, as I gained valuable experiences both inside and outside of school.<sub>12</sub> I formed a solid circle of friends with whom I bonded over meals, studies, and various outings.<sub>13</sub> We helped each other through academic struggles, shared dreams, and celebrated small victories together.<sub>14</sub> Academically, I excelled once again, graduating with honors and high honors.<sub>15</sub> I became more confident in my abilities and embraced my strengths.<sub>16</sub> Senior high school also exposed me to various opportunities that shaped my career aspirations.<sub>17</sub> I participated in group projects and had our research as well.<sub>18</sub> These experiences helped me become more resilient and prepared me for the challenges ahead.<sub>19</sub> Although my teenage years had their ups and downs, they played a significant role in shaping my identity and preparing me for the future.<sub>20</sub>

    My college experience began with a rocky start.<sub>1</sub> As a late enrollee, I had no prior connections with my classmates and was placed in a free section, which made it difficult to form lasting friendships.<sub>2</sub> Though my classmates were approachable, I didn't develop close bonds during my first semester.<sub>3</sub> I often felt isolated and struggled to adapt to the fast-paced nature of college life.<sub>4</sub> However, things began to improve when I joined a block section during my second semester.<sub>5</sub> It was there that I met a group of friends who remain by my side as I continue my studies.<sub>6</sub> They provided me with the support system I needed, making my college life more enjoyable.<sub>7</sub> Pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) was initially a challenge, especially since my senior high school education in STEM didnâ€™t include much exposure to ICT or programming.<sub>8</sub> At first, I found programming intimidating and doubted whether I could excel in the field.<sub>9</sub> Despite these fears, I remained determined to succeed.<sub>10</sub> I studied more and focused on improving my coding skills.<sub>11</sub> Over time, I saw improvement, and my grades consistently reflected my efforts.<sub>12</sub> While I may not be the best at everything, Iâ€™ve learned to focus on personal growth rather than perfection.<sub>13</sub> College life has taught me the importance of balance, and I prioritize staying motivated while avoiding burnout.<sub>14</sub> Outside of academics, I made time to explore new interests and experiences, expanding my horizons beyond the classroom.<sub>15</sub> These experiences helped me realize my passion for both technology and personal development.<sub>16</sub> My career goals became clearer as I gained more exposure to the tech industry.<sub>17</sub> I dream of one day working in the field, gaining experience, and eventually starting my own business.<sub>18</sub> Traveling and experiencing different cultures is also a major part of my life, and Iâ€™m grateful that my family shares this love for exploration.<sub>19</sub> As I continue my college journey, I feel more equipped to face the challenges ahead.<sub>20</sub> Though the road is long, I am optimistic about the future and excited to take on whatever comes next in both my career and personal life.<sub>21</sub>
